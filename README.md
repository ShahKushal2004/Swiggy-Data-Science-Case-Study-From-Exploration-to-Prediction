# Swiggy-Data-Science-Case-Study-From-Exploration-to-Prediction
This project is a comprehensive data analysis case study based on Swiggy's food delivery dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights that can help Swiggy improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth.

We focus on solving two major business problems:

📈 Demand Forecasting
Predicting future monthly order volumes using historical sales data. This helps the business plan inventory, manage delivery staff, and launch targeted marketing campaigns ahead of peak demand.

🍽️ Cuisine Optimization by City
Analyzing which cuisines perform best in specific cities. This enables Swiggy to localize offerings, partner with the right restaurants, and better serve customer preferences.

The analysis is performed using Python, with libraries such as Pandas, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and insights are visualized using tools like Power BI and Tableau. The entire data pipeline—from storage and querying to modeling and reporting—follows a structured workflow that reflects real-world analytics processes.

The project follows a clear pipeline from data storage to visualization:

🗂️ Data Storage
Raw data collected from Swiggy, stored in Excel files or uploaded to Snowflake (cloud data warehouse).

🧾 Querying Data
Data is queried using PostgreSQL and DbVisualizer for exploration.

Python is used for deeper analysis and data manipulation.

📈 Data Visualization
Insights are visualized using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and platforms such as Tableau and Power BI to present findings in a clear and compelling manner
